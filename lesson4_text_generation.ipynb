    "- Your AI's translation\n",
    "- A human reference translation\n",

    "- 1-gram (unigram): single word [\"cat\"]\n",
    "- 2-gram (bigram): two words [\"the cat\"]  \n",
    "- 3-gram (trigram): three words [\"the cat sat\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Metaphor\n",
    "Imagine translating English → Spanish. BLEU is like a teacher who:\n",
    "1. Checks if you used the right words ✓\n",
    "2. Checks if you put them in the right order ✓\n",
    "3. Doesn't care if you understood the meaning ✗\n",

    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Reference: \"The cat sat on the mat\"\n",
    "- Your AI: \"Cat mat on sat the\" ← All the right words, WRONG order!\n",
    "- BLEU: \"Yo this is trash\" (low score)\n",

    "### Why BLEU has limitations (but is still widely used)\n",
    "- Uses \"quick\" and \"fast\"? BLEU thinks they're different words 🤦\n",
    "- Synonyms? BLEU doesn't know what those are\n",
